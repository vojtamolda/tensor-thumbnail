// Background story on `TensorElementLiteral` and why it's necessary:
//
// Very importantly, we want users to be able to implicitly convert an array
// literal to a tensor. At first glance, a straightfoward implementation would
// be conforming `Tensor` to `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral` with
// `ExpressibleBy(Float|Int|Bool)Literal` as a base case. However, it is not
// that simple. We have binary operators that take `(Tensor, Scalar)`, `(Scalar,
// Tensor)` as well as `(Tensor, Tensor)`. When `Tensor`s are convertible from
// both a scalar and an array literal, a scalar-tensor binary operator like `+`
// will not type check.
//
// One way to work around it is to define all tensor-tensor operators in a
// protocol extension, and all tensor-scalar and scalar-tensor operators on
// concrete `Tensor`. Protocol extensions are less favorable than concrete
// implementations, so the compiler will prefer the concrete implementation for
// a scalar-tensor operation. However, this would cause enormous code bloat and
// is entirely a hack.
//
// To resolve ambiguity, `Tensor` should not be expressible by scalar literal.
// There's already a lightweight syntax for converting a scalar to a tensor:
// `Tensor(x)`, so there is no strong need for implicit conversion. But we need
// to find a way to give `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral` a base case: what would the
// `ArrayLiteralElement` be if we want to support both `[1,2,3]` and `[[[1,2],
// [1,2]]]`? In the first case the array literal element is an interger, while
// in the second case the array literal itself should be a tensor. Based on this
// observation, we come up with an intermediate type: `TensorElementLiteral` as
// the `ArrayLiteralElement` of `Tensor`. By making `TensorElementLiteral`
// expressible by both array literal and scalar literal, `Tensor` can now be
// converted from an arbitrary-dimensional array literal.
//
// Due to protocol requirements, `TensorElementLiteral` has to be
// public. It is never supposed to be used directly by any user, so the library
// convention is to prepend an underscore to its name, making it
// `_TensorElementLiteral`.
//
// It would be nice to be able to remove this type when we can systematically
// resolve tensor-scalar/scalar-tensor op ambiguity someday, either through an
// improved `Expressible` model, or by introducing an attribute to tell the type
// checker which function to prefer when ambiguity occurs.
/// Represents a literal element for conversion to a `Tensor`.
///
/// - Note: Do not ever use this API directly. This is implicitly created
///   during the conversion from an array literal to a `Tensor`, and is purely
///   for implementation purposes.
